        <p>The great wildebeest migration is one of the world’s most extraordinary wildlife <br>
    spectacles and a signature experience for travelers exploring Kenya and Tanzania <br> 
    with rws. Every year more than 1.5million wildebeest, accompanied by zebras and <br>
     antelopes, journey across the Serengeti- Masai Mara ecosystem in search of fresh <br>
      grazing and water. This continuous movement –filled with dramatic river crossing, <br>
       predator encounters, and sweeping herds –has earned its title as one of the wonders <br>
        of the world. </p>
        <br>
        <p>A Natural Wonder like No Other The Migration is a powerful display of nature’s <br>
             rhythm and one of the top reasons travelers’ choose an East African safari. <br>

             interactions with lions, cheetahs, hyenas and crocodiles The famous Mara river <br>
              crossings, known for their intensity and unpredictability Beautiful seasonal <br>
              landscapes –from the Serengeti calving grounds to the Masai Mara golden savannahs. <br>
